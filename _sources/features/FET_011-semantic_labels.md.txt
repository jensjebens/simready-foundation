# Feature: `ID:011 - Semantic Labels - Base`

## Description
This feature describes the requirements necessary to have semantic label attributes on geometry prims. These semantics may be used to provide ground truth for ML training by verifying perception system identification and classification of objects.

* Obtain the usd sdk
  * [usd sdk link](https://developer.nvidia.com/usd?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured_in.usd_resources%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc&hitsPerPage=6#section-getting-started)
* Confirm your asset in question has passed validation
* In your commandline type:
  * ```path/to/usdsdk/scripts/usdrecord <path to usdfile.usd> <path to output.png>```
* Open up path/to/output.png
* Expected Result:
  * Confirm it is NOT empty or completely black
  * All geometry prims should have semantic labels
  * Semantic labels should use proper schema and not contain time samples

#### Comments

This feature enables ML training ground truth by providing semantic label attributes on geometry prims. The requirements ensure that all geometry is properly labeled using the SemanticsLabelsAPI schema, with support for Wikidata ontology Q-Codes and proper time-invariant labeling for sensor simulation.
