# Feature: `ID:002 - Posable Bodies - Base`
## Description
This feature describes the minimal requirements necessary to have assets in space that can be posed. This is the basis for animations that have the ability to animate via USD time samples.

#### Used in Profiles

This version is not currently used in any profiles.

#### Requirements
* Capability [Hierarchy](../capabilities/hierarchy/capability-hierarchy.md) 
    * Requirements
        * [Exclusive-Xform-Parent-For-UsdGeom](../capabilities/hierarchy/requirements/exclusive-xform-parent-for-usdgeom.md)
            * HI.002  | Version 0.1.0
            * Description
                * Requirement that a UsdGeomPrim always has a parent xform. 
                * Xform parent has at least one xformop:translate and one xformop: orient.  (xformop:scale is optional)
                * Xform parent only has 1 UsdGeomPrim as it's child.
                * If referencePrim has authored reference, then we need to check the heiarchy of the reference to make sure the heiarchy still complies with above requirement.
            * [Rule | Implementation](../capabilities/hierarchy/validation.py)

        * [Hierarchy-Has-Root](../capabilities/hierarchy/requirements/hierarchy-has-root.md)
            * HI.004 | Version 0.1.0
            * Description
                * We don't want scattered referencePrims (xforms)...requirement is to ensure that the reference prim (xforms) all route to a single root or ancestor referencePrim (xform).
            * [Rule | Implementation](../capabilities/hierarchy/validation.py)
   


* Capability: [Visualization/Geometry](../capabilities/visualization/geometry/capability-geometry.md)
    * Requirements
        * [At-Least-One-Imageable-Geometry](../capabilities/visualization/geometry/requirements/at-least-one-imageable-geometry.md)
        * VG.001 | Version 0.1.0
        * [Rule | Implementation](../capabilities/visualization/geometry/validation.py)

        
#### Test Process


* Obtain Isaac Sim
    * 4.5 is public and can be downloaded [here](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/download.html)
    * 5.0 requires users to build on their systems, you can follow the docs [here](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/5.0.0/installation/download.html)
* Find directory where Isaac Sim was installed
    * Launch isaacsim.bat
    * In Isaac Sim, open path to Sample Object (or your target)
    * Click on xform's above each mesh. 
        * Rotate the parent
        * Result: the whole object should move
        * ![image1](./images/pose_testing_logical_root.png)
    * Click in child xform (underneath parent)
        * Rotate the child xform
        * Result: the child's mesh should move
        *![image2](./images/pose_testing_children.png)
* Expected Result:
    * Every mesh is affected by at least one Xform
    * If nested hierarchy, the grandparent Xform will move entire group
    * Video Examples:
